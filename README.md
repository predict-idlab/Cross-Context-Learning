Enabling Cross-Context Learning with Knowledge Graphs for Anomaly Detection
==============================

Experiments to perform anomaly detection using autoencoder-based techniques. Experiments make use of cross-context learning to support dynamic adaptation of anomaly detectors to new deployment contexts. 


Running
-------

1. Clone this project: `git clone...`.
2. Preferably create a virtual environment (`conda create --name crosscontext`) and activate it (`conda activate crosscontext `).
3. `cd` to the project's root folder and install all required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. `experiments.py` contains cross-context experiments for various transfer criteria.
